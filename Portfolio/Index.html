                        <p>Before enrolling in the stack summer camp, the only coding experience I had was with java in the eclipse workspace. I’ll admit it was frustrating trying to learn a new concept that others already seemed familiar with. However, the frustration proved rewarding as it taught me how to independently learn and ask others for help. When faced with a dilemma I didn't know how to solve, I would first independently look for a solution using my resources (the google drive, notes I took, stack overflow, etc.) and then reach out to others if I could not come to a conclusion. This taught me the essential skill of independent learning which will be very useful in college and my career!</p>

                        <p>The File IO project was the first time I ever worked on a SCRUM team with Git. This experience showed me how essential it is to communicate the delegated work (try to avoid those pesky merge conflicts) and to ask/answer questions of uncertainty. It additionally taught me the way to translate my Java experience to an unfamiliar language: C#. This proves immensely valuable as the tech industry continues to expand, one must stay flexible and adapt to syntax changes.</p>

                        <p>Before this project, I dabbled in HTML soley by inspecting elements on websites. So at first it was very overwhelming to be thrown all this material but I was more than happy to learn as I found it very interesting. This project really taught me the importance of using "tools that people smarter than you" have created to enhance a project (i.e. Bootstrap and Vue) and not to be intimidated by material, but to be curious while deciphering it.</p>

                        <p>This intro to full stack development showed me the many ways to code the same function and the differences of each (javascript on client and in the controller on server). Going forward, it is important to keep in mind these differences and consider whether it is more efficent to complete a feature on the client or server side. Additionally, Razor Code reinforced the idea of using shortcuts to complete otherwise complex features.</p>
